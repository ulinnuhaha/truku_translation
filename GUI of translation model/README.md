# Run the GUI of the translation model
This is a repository for creating the GUI of the translation model between Truku and Chinese languages (Truku â†” Chinese).
We use the Gradio to build simple inference of the translation model in GUI form.
Before running the translation model, this directory should have the sub-directory of the fine-tuned translation model as we named it with `pretrained_model`. For the fine-tuned model, we use `./pretrained_model/nllb_expanded_tr_ch`.
Then, you can run the `run_app.py` script as follows:
